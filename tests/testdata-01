The auricular style or lobate style (Dutch: Kwabstijl) is a style of ornamental decoration, especially found in Northern Europe of the first half of the 17th century, bridging Northern Mannerism and the Baroque. The style was especially important and effective in silversmithing but used in minor architectural ornamentation such as door and window reveals and a wide variety of the decorative arts.[1] It uses softly flowing abstract shapes in relief, sometimes asymetrical, whose resemblance to the side view of the human ear gives it its name, or at least its "undulating, slithery and boneless forms occasionally carry a suggestion of the inside of an ear or a conch shell".[2] It is often associated with stylized marine animal forms, or ambiguous masks and shapes that might be such, which seem to emerge from the rippling, fluid background, as if the silver remained in its molten state.
